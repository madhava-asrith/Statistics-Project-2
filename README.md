1. Find real data such that the values are positive. Suppose you model the data using a Gamma(a,b) distribution. What is the method of moments (MoM) and maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for the two parameters a and b?

2. Now model the same data as a Normal distribution with an unknown mean and variance. Find the 95% confidence interval for the variance parameter.

3. Collect real data for two relevant yet non-overlapping populations. If you model them as independent normal distributions with unknown means and variances, what will be the 95%  confidence interval for the difference in the means of the two populations?

4. Collect real data with binary response, which you can model as Bernoulli distributed data. Let p denote the probability of success defined here. Test for the H0: p <= 1/2 vs H1: p > 1/2. Comprehensively test the hypothesis at a level of significance of 0.05.

Note that the real data you work on may not necessarily follow the distributions you assume above. For the time being, that is fine.
